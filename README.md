# UCSC Basic Needs Navigator

## Overview

Many on-campus basic needs facilities at UCSC are underutilized due to lack of awareness and accessibility issues. This app aims to bridge that gap by:

- Providing a platform for facilities to list available products (with photos).
- Utilizing AI-powered image processing to automatically itemize and categorize uploaded images of products.
- Offering an interactive map for students to locate and navigate to these facilities.
- (In progress) Allowing users to leave comments, questions, and suggestions for each facility.

This app ensures that students can easily access essential resources, reducing food waste and supporting a more sustainable campus.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Image Recognition:** Automatically detects and categorizes products from uploaded images, reducing manual data entry for facility staff.
- **View Product Listings:** See what’s available at each facility, including AI-tagged images.
- **Navigate with Google Maps:** Easily find and get directions to any facility.
- **(Upcoming) Feedback & FAQ System:** Users can ask questions and suggest improvements, with automatic email notifications to facility managers.
## AI Image Processing

The app leverages AI-driven image recognition to streamline inventory management:

1. Facility staff upload images of available products.
2. AI processes the images, identifies items, and categorizes them automatically.
3. Users can browse itemized product lists without manual updates.

This technology helps ensure that inventory remains accurate and up-to-date with minimal effort.

- Automating inventory updates through AI, ensuring accurate and accessible listings.
